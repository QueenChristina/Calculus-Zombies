# Calculus-Zombies
Memorize derivatives and integrals quickly through this game of survival against zombies!
<br> Work in progress. Currently learning Sympy and will translate to Pygame for a fun mini game. Helps calculus students memorize those pesky
trig or polynomial derivatives and integrals!
<br> Follow this project to keep updated. Will add visuals and fun soon. ;)
